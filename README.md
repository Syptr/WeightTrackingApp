# WeightTrackingApp

• **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**<br><br>
	  &emsp;The Weight Tracking App was developed for a user to login and track their daily weight with the option of setting a goal weight. The user must be able to create a new account, manipulate their data by adding, updating, or deleting entries, and setting/updating a goal weight. The user has the option to grant SMS permissions so they can receive a notification once their goal weight has been achieved. However, the functionality of the app is not affected if the user choses not to grant this permission.
  
• **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**<br><br>
	&emsp;To support the user needs a screen for login, displaying the users’ weights, adding a weight, setting a goal weight, deleting a weight, and updating a weight were created. The UI is user-centered with intuitive navigation and clearly labeled buttons for manipulating entries. The designs are successful because they keep the user in mind.
  
•	**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**<br><br>
	&emsp;To create this app, I started by understanding the user needs and transferred those to user stories and test cases. I then created a wireframe that allowed me to map the flow of events for reference while coding. The final step was coding the program which I approached by creating classes for the database, database objects, main login, and activities. This approach will be useful in the future because the methodical provides for efficient production.
  
•	**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**<br><br>
	&emsp;Testing an application is important so that the user doesn’t encounter bugs when your app hits the market. This type of error could result in loss of sales and poor publicity. Testing also helps uncover issues you might not have foreseen giving you an opportunity to improve. To test my app, I used the test cases I created with the user stories so I could ensure my app was functional for users. 

•	**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**<br><br>
	&emsp;My initial plan, and code, was designed as a recycler view using cards for the user to interact with the database. However, when I tried to access the database with a specific user the view no longer functioned properly. Due to time constraints this resulted in a pivot to the list view. In the end, I was able to keep the theme of the app but with a slightly different UI experience. This process taught me a lot about being resourceful and not to get discouraged if things don’t work right the first couple times - there is always an alternate solution.

•	**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**<br><br>
	&emsp;At this point my app is not ready to be released to the app store for users. However, as a first-time mobile developer, I am proud of what I've accomplished and all that I've learned during the process. I look forward to improving upon this app and applying my new skills to other apps in the future.
